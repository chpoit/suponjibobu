Spongebobify your text.

I didn't feel like seeding the rng generator so you can run it multiple times and get new results.

There is an increasing bias towards uppercasing characters if the previous character(s) was not uppercase'd.

# Run it:
## Online
Go [here](chpoit.com/suponjibobu) for a web version.

## Node
- Have any version of NodeJS installed (dyno probably works too)
- run either:
  - `node src/suponjibobu.js <Your message>` for a single message
  - `node src/suponjibobu.js "<Message1>" "<Message2>" ... "<MessageN>"` for a multiple messages (add quotes)
